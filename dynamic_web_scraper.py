# Need to first install Selenium
# Then install a driver for the appropriate web browser you're using (GeckoDriver for Mozilla or ChromeDriver for Chrome)
# Each will be a downloadable that will be used in the 'driver_path' below

# Set the path to your WebDriver executable

# Initialize the Chrome driver

# Navigate to the webpage with the org chart

driver.get(url)

# Wait for the dynamic content to load (you may need to adjust the wait time)

# Locate and extract the org chart elements

# Print or process the org chart data as needed
